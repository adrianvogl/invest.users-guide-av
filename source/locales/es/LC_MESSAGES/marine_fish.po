"Supporting the production of aquacultured fish and shellfish is an "
"important service provided by coastal and marine environments.  Because "
"salmon is one of the two most important finfish in aquaculture worldwide,"
" the current version of the InVEST aquaculture model analyzes the volume "
"and economic value of Atlantic salmon (*Salmo salar*) grown in netpen "
"aquaculture facilities based on farming practices, water temperature, and"
" economic factors. Inputs for the present model include farm location, "
"management practices at the facilities, water temperature, economic data "
"for valuation, and the time period over which results are of interest.  "
"This model is best used to evaluate how human activities (e.g., the "
"addition or removal of farms or changes in harvest management practices) "
"and climate change (e.g., change in sea surface temperature) may affect "
"the production and economic value of aquacultured Atlantic salmon.  "
"Limitations of the model include assumptions that harvest practices, "
"prices, and costs of production of aquacultured fish are constant for the"
" selected time period.  Additionally, risk of disease outbreaks and "
"variability between individual salmon within a farm are not included in "
"the model."

"Human demand for protein from the ocean has rapidly increased and is "
"projected to continue to do so in coming decades (Delgado et al. 2003, "
"Halwart et al. 2007, Soto et al. 2008).  In recent years, the scales, "
"previously tilted towards provisioning of protein from capture fisheries,"
" have shifted toward aquaculture (Griffin et al., 2015).  In particular, "
"finfish aquaculture, primarily for Atlantic salmon, has intensified in "
"coastal areas over the past two decades (FAO 2004, Goldburg and Naylor "
"2004, Naylor and Burke 2005).  In 2002, farmed salmon production, over "
"90% of which was for Atlantic salmon, was 68% higher than the volume of "
"wild capture (FAO 2004).  Atlantic salmon farming, conducted in floating "
"netpens in low energy, nearshore areas, is a well-established, "
"consolidated industry that operates in the temperate waters of Norway, "
"Chile, the United Kingdom and Canada."

"Commercial operations for Atlantic salmon use the marine environment to "
"produce a valuable commodity, which generates revenue and is a source of "
"employment. Yet salmon farming is controversial due to potentially "
"adverse impacts to marine ecosystems and, thereby, people who derive "
"their livelihoods from those ecosystems (e.g., commercial fishermen, "
"tourism operators).  Concerns about the effects of Atlantic salmon "
"aquaculture on the marine ecosystem involve debate about the impacts of "
"emission of dissolved and solid wastes to water quality and living "
"habitats, degradation of water quality due to use of antibiotics, mixing "
"and competition of escaped farmed salmon with endemic species (e.g., "
"Pacific salmon), increased risk of parasitism and disease, and depletion "
"of forage fish resources harvested from other ecosystems for use as "
"Atlantic salmon feed."

"Regulations for the Atlantic salmon aquaculture industry vary regionally,"

msgid ""
"The model is designed to address how the production and economic value of"
" farmed Atlantic salmon at individual aquaculture facilities and across a"
" user-defined study area change depending on farm operations and changes "
"in water temperature.  Temporal shifts in price, costs or harvest "
"management practices are not dynamically modeled, but can be represented "
"by running the model sequentially, where each run uses different "
"information on prices, costs and farm operations.  The risk of disease "
"outbreaks and variability between individual salmon within a farm are not"
" included in the model.   The model will yield the most accurate outputs "
"when parameterized with site-specific temperature and farm operations "
"data.  If site-specific data are unavailable, the provided ranges of "
"default values can be used to yield first approximations of results (see "
":ref:`aq-data-needs` section)."

"The model is run simultaneously for all Atlantic salmon farms identified "
"by the user.  Each farm can have a user-defined set of operations and "
"management practices.  The volume of fish produced on a farm depends on "
"water temperature (which affects growth), the number of fish on the farm,"
" the target harvest weight range, and the mortality rate.  Fish growth is"
" modeled on a daily time-step until the fish reach the target harvest "
"weight range, after which they are harvested.  After a user-defined "
"fallowing period, the farm is restocked and this initiates the next "
"production cycle.  Production cycles continue for each farm until the end"
" of the time period of interest (e.g., 2 years, 10 years).  Outputs "
"include the harvested weight of fish and net revenue per cycle for each "
"individual farm.  In addition, the model yields a map of the total "
"harvested weight, total net revenue, and net present value over the time "
"period of interest."
