"The model interface consists of a form with one field for each model "
"input. For input files, you may type out the path or use the file "

"Each model's page in this guide contains a **Data Needs** section that "
"describes the format for each input. The :ref:`data_sources` page has "
"guidance on finding data for common model inputs. Many models also have "
"an **Appendix** with guidance on finding data specific to the model. The "
"**sample data** provides examples of each input."

"InVEST validates all inputs as you enter them to make sure that the "
"format is correct. This checks things like: - a CSV contains all the "
"expected columns - a numeric input is within the allowed range - all the "
"spatial inputs overlap You cannot run the model until all inputs pass "
"validation. On the left side, a green checkmark indicates the input looks"
" correct, while a red X indicates a problem. Click on the red X to see a "
"description of the problem."

msgid ""
"All InVEST models support avoided re-computation. This means that the "
"model will detect intermediate and final results from a previous run in "
"the specified workspace and it will avoid re-calculating any outputs that"
" are identical to the previous run. This can save significant processing "
"time for successive runs when only some input parameters have changed. "
"Note that this only works within a workspace and with the same suffix. If"
" you delete or change the workspace directory, or change the results "
"suffix, no re-computation is avoided."

"*File > Settings > taskgraph_n_workers_parameter*. Not all model "
"operations can run in parallel and the optimal number of CPUs to use is "
"dependent on the input datasets."
