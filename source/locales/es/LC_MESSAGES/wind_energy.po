"Offshore wind energy is gaining interest worldwide, with 5,400 megawatts "
"(MW) installed as of January 2013 and a growth rate around 25% per year "
"(GWEC, 2013). Consistently higher offshore winds and proximity to coastal"
" load centers serve as two of the major reasons wind energy developers "
"are looking offshore. The goal of the InVEST offshore wind energy model "
"is to provide spatial maps of energy resource availability, energy "
"generation potential, and (optionally) energy generation value to allow "
"users to evaluate siting decisions, use tradeoffs, and an array of other "
"marine spatial planning questions. The model was developed to allow "
"maximum flexibility for the user, in that it can be run with default data"
" and parameters, but it can just as easily be updated with new turbine "
"and foundation information, grid connection information, and parameter "
"values that fit the user’s context. Model outputs include wind power "
"potential, energy generation, offset carbon emissions, net present value,"
" and levelized cost of energy, all given at the farm level."

"This wind energy model provides an easily replicable interface to assess "
"the viability of wind energy in your region under different farm design "
"scenarios. The outputs are raster maps, whose point values represent the "
"aggregate value of a farm centered at that point. This allows for "
"detailed analysis of siting choices at a fine scale, though it comes at "
"the cost of assuming that conditions are sufficiently symmetric around "
"the center point so that the center point represents the median "
"conditions of all turbines in the farm. Since the user can select the "
"number of turbines for the farm, and the raster maps do not give an "
"indication of farm size, the model also outputs a representative polyline"
" polygon at a randomly selected wind data point that indicates the size "
"of the farm."

"To run the model, you are asked to supply information into the graphical "
"user interface. This includes information about wind energy conditions, "
"the type of turbine, number of turbines, the area of interest, etc. To "
"make the model easier to run, it includes default data in `.csv` tables "
"on two common offshore wind turbines: 3.6 MW and 5.0 MW. We also include "
"two wind speed datasets: a global dataset and a dataset covering the "
"Northwest Atlantic. Finally, it includes a table of less commonly changed"
" default values used to parameterize various parts of the model, called "
"the \"Global Wind Energy Parameters\" file. These `.csv` files are "
"required inputs, and may be modified if alternate values are desired by "
"directly editing the files using a text editor or Microsoft Excel. When "
"modifying these files, it is recommended that the user make a copy of the"
" default `.csv` file so as not to lose the original default values."

"All foundations should feature an increasing cost with depth as material "
"costs will necessarily be higher; however, this is not captured in this "
"model currently due to the paucity of project cost data to estimate such "
"a relationship. Jacquemin et al. (2011) used field data to estimate "
"foundation weight as a function of water depth; however the data and "
"functions are not given making it impossible to replicate their work. "
"Nonetheless, this source does provide a means to approximate different "

"Samoteskul et al. (2014) demonstrate how the data from Jacquemin et al. "

"Electricity transmission equipment is much harder to model at the "
"component level because the optimal transmission system design varies "
"considerably with local conditions and wind farm design. Depending on the"
" size of the farm and its distance from shore, offshore platforms with "
"voltage transformers, converters, and switchgear may be needed. "
"Additionally, there is a critical point where a wind farm's distance from"
" the grid requires a switch from alternating current (AC) power to direct"
" current (DC) power to overcome line losses which reduce the amount of "
"energy delivered. Given design variation across different contexts, we "
"utilized a top-down modeling approach for transmission costs to allow the"
" model to be used broadly without the need for exhaustive system modeling"
" and unit cost information. We collected information about electricity "
"transmission costs (including installation) from 20 wind farms and used "
"it to estimate a relationship between total costs and farm "
"characteristics. This data was collected from the U.K. Ofgem tender "
"process (https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/electricity/transmission-networks"
"/offshore-transmission) and is shown in Table 2."

"Since capital expenditures represent the largest proportion of costs, and"
" much of the ancillary costs are fixed fractions of capital costs, it is "
"critically important to validate our model against stated offshore wind "
"farm costs worldwide. To do so, we collected data from "
"https://www.4coffshore.com/ and https://www.lorc.dk/offshore-wind-farms-"
"map/statistics on stated capital costs and designs for wind farms that "
"are in construction or currently operational. We constrained the data "
"collection to only those employing 3.6 MW and 5.0 MW turbines, for which "
"we have provided default data with the InVEST model. Stated capital costs"
" gathered from 4Coffshore were inflated to 2012 $US using their supplied "
"financial close information as the basis for when the cost estimate was "
"collected. To generate predictions, the design of each farm was input "
"into the InVEST model using appropriate default cost parameters for all "
"components. Most farms have their own electrical transmission equipment, "
"though some deepwater farms are beginning to used centralized offshore "
"substations that aggregate energy for transport from multiple farms. To "
"predict electrical transmission costs for these farms, it was first "
"necessary to estimate the cost of the entire offshore substation and then"
" attribute a prorated capital cost to each farm based on their relative "
"contribution to exported energy capacity. For example, an offshore "
"substation with a 800 MW export capacity that is connected to Farm A (200"
" MW) and Farm B (600 MW) would contribute 25% of capital costs to Farm A "
"and 75% to Farm B. The results of our validation show a very strong "
"correlation between predictions and stated capital costs for 3.6 MW and "
"5.0 MW turbines using the default data (see Figure 5.6)."
