"The GLOBIO model provides an index of biodiversity according to mean "
"species abundance (MSA), the average population-level response across a "
"range of species, to different stressors, including land-use change, "
"fragmentation, and infrastructure. The model can be used as a static "
"assessment of how far below a pristine state the current environment is "
"or to estimate how a change in any of the stressors would lead to a "
"stress in biodiversity or ecosystem integrity, as indicated by MSA."

"The GLOBIO methodology was developed by the United Nations Environmental "
"Programme (UNEP, Alkemade et al. 2009) to model human impacts on "
"biodiversity, measured by mean species abundance (MSA). Mean Species "
"Abundance is an improvement over the more traditional species-area curve "
"approach for two reasons. First, it gives aggregate estimates of species "
"densities, not just species presence, which is important to represent "
"true diversity since presence alone gives limited information about "
"population viability (Balmford et al 2012). Second, it relates more than "
"habitat area to changes in biodiversity by including information about "
"the impact of fragmentation and threats from infrastructure (and climate "
"change and nitrogen deposition if the full version of GLOBIO were "
"implemented)."

msgid ""
"The GLOBIO approach is based on mean species abundance (MSA, see Schwartz"
" et al. 2003 for an example usage of MSA). An MSA estimation ranges from "
"0 to 1, indicating the average proportional change in abundance of "
"individual species in a location against that same location being "
"pristine vegetation. An MSA of 1.0 implies that on average, species "
"abundances are the same as in pristine land while an MSA of 0.0 implies "
"that average species abundance is zero. Comparing MSA values of different"
" scenarios identifies how anthropogenic changes affect biodiversity "
"(e.g., changing from a scenario with a mean MSA of 0.6 to a new scenario "
"with 0.5 implies that, on average, individual species’ abundances "
"declined 16.6% due to the land use change). In GLOBIO, an MSA value is "
"defined for every grid-cell within a geospatial extent."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/globio.rst:57
msgid ""
"Stressors decrease MSA in a multiplicative way. In the GLOBIO3 paper, the"
" stressors included land use/land cover (LU), excess atmospheric nitrogen"
" deposition (N), proximity of infrastructure (mainly roads; I), "
"fragmentation (F) and climate change (CC), as in the following equation "
"to calculate MSA per pixel (i):"
msgstr ""

"To consider changes in land-use, we ignore the nitrogen deposition term "
"and climate change terms; since neither of these terms change with each "

"We refine the GLOBIO methodology for MSA change due to infrastructure, "
"fragmentation, and land-use in order to make use of higher resolution "
"land-use/land-cover data (500 m pixels from MODIS rather than 50 km "
"pixels used by UNEP) needed to detect finer-scale ecological response "
"that may include nonlinearities. Downscaling requires new methods for "
"assigning land management regime sub-classes with more precision based on"
