"The freshwater models in InVEST are routed across a digital elevation "
"model (DEM).  In the course of developing InVEST we've found existing "
"implementations of flow direction and flow accumulation algorithms to be "
"lacking.  To address this need, we have developed our own high "
"performance implementations of the D8 flow direction algorithm and "
"fractional flow (\"Multiple Flow Direction\" - MFD), combined with a "
"plateau resolution algorithm to route across flat areas (Garbrecht and "
"Martz) that outperforms TauDEM and GRASS implementations.  We feel these "
"implementations are useful enough that we offer them as a standalone tool"
" that can:"

"This tool may be useful when you are preparing your DEM for use in the "
"freshwater models. For these models, you will want to create streams that"
" are continuous (not all chopped up), and you will need to choose a "
"Threshold Flow Accumulation value that creates a modeled stream network "
"that is as close as possible to the real-world stream network. Using "
"RouteDEM you can test your DEM, see how InVEST handles it, and create "
"stream rasters to help you choose an appropriate Threshold value, without"
" needing to run the whole freshwater model."
