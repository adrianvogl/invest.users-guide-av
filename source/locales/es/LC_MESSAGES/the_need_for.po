"Ecosystems, if properly managed, yield a flow of services that are vital "
"to humanity, including the production of goods (e.g., food), life support"
" processes (e.g., water purification), and life fulfilling conditions "
"(e.g., beauty, recreation opportunities), as well as the conservation of "
"options (e.g., genetic diversity for future use). Despite its importance,"
" this natural capital is poorly understood, scarcely monitored, and—in "
"many cases—undergoing rapid degradation and depletion. To bring "
"understanding of nature’s values into decisions, the Natural Capital "
"Project is developing models that quantify and map the values of "
"ecosystem services. The modeling suite is best suited for analyses of "
"multiple services and multiple objectives. The current models, which have"
" low data requirements relative to more complex tools, can identify areas"
" where investment may enhance human well-being and nature. We are "
"continuing to refine existing models and to develop new ones."

"We use the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005) definition of the term "
"ecosystem services: “the benefits people obtain from ecosystems.” "
"Ecosystems incorporate both biotic and abiotic components and we thus "
"consider “ecosystem services” and “environmental services” to be "
"equivalent. Natural capital is the living and non-living components of "
"ecosystems that contribute to the provision of ecosystem services. "
"Capital assets take many forms including manufactured capital (e.g., "
"buildings and machines), human capital (knowledge, experience, and "
"health), social capital (relationships and institutions), as well as "
"natural capital."

"InVEST is designed to inform decisions about natural resource management."
" Essentially, it provides information about how changes in ecosystems are"
" likely to lead to changes in the flows of benefits to people. Decision-"
"makers, from governments to non-profits to corporations, often manage "
"lands and waters for multiple uses and inevitably must evaluate trade-"
"offs among these uses. InVEST’s multi-service, modular design provides an"
" effective tool for exploring the likely outcomes of alternative "
"management and climate scenarios and for evaluating trade-offs among "
"sectors and services. For example, government agencies could use InVEST "
"to help determine how to manage lands, coasts, and marine areas to "
"provide a desirable range of benefits to people or to help design "
"permitting and mitigation programs that sustain nature’s benefits to "
"society. Conservation organizations could use InVEST to better align "
"their missions to protect biodiversity with activities that improve human"
" livelihoods. Corporations, such as consumer goods companies, renewable "
"energy companies, and water utilities, could also use InVEST to decide "
"how and where to invest in natural capital to ensure that their supply "
"chains are sustainable and secure."

"InVEST often employs a production function approach to quantifying and "
"valuing ecosystem services. A production function specifies the output of"
" ecosystem services provided by the environment given its condition and "

"impact of changes on land or in the water on changes on the level of "

"“Supply” represents what is potentially available from the ecosystem (ie."

"mangrove forest. “Service” incorporates demand and thus uses information "
"about beneficiaries of that service (e.g., where people live, important "
"cultural sites, infrastructure, etc.). “Value” includes social preference"

"The InVEST toolset described in this guide includes models for "
"quantifying, mapping, and valuing the benefits provided by terrestrial, "
"freshwater, and marine systems. We group models in InVEST into four "
"primary categories: 1) supporting services, 2) final services, 3) tools "
"to facilitate ecosystem service analyses and 4) supporting tools. "
"Supporting services underpin other ecosystem services, but do not "
"directly provide benefits to people. Final services provide direct "
"benefits to people. For final services, we split the services into their "
"biophysical supply and the service to people wherever possible. For some "
"final services, we model the service directly, without modeling the "
"supply separately. Supporting tools include helping to create watersheds,"
" do hydrological processing on a digital elevation model and create "
"scenarios that can be used as inputs to InVEST."

"Information about changes in ecosystem services is most likely to make a "
"difference when questions are driven by decision-makers and stakeholders,"
" rather than by scientists and analysts. We have found that InVEST is "
"most effective when used within a decision-making process. The Natural "
"Capital Project has used InVEST in over 60 countries worldwide. See the "
"Where We Work section of the NatCap website "
"(https://naturalcapitalproject.stanford.edu/impact/where-we-work) for the"

"Our approach (Figure 2) starts with a series of stakeholder "
"consultations. Through discussion, questions of interest to policy "
"makers, communities and conservation groups are identified. These "
"questions may concern service delivery on a landscape today and how these"
" services may be affected by new programs, policies, and conditions in "
"the future. For questions regarding the future, stakeholders develop "
"*scenarios* to explore the consequences of expected changes on natural "
"resources. These scenarios typically include a map of future land use and"
" land cover or, for the marine models, a map of future coastal and ocean "
"uses and coastal/marine habitats. These scenarios that are assessed for "
"ecosystem service value by biophysical and economic models that produce "
"several types of outputs. Following stakeholder consultations and "
"scenario development, InVEST can estimate the amount of ecosystem "
"services that are provided on the current landscape or under future "
"scenarios. InVEST models are spatially explicit, using maps as "
"information sources and producing maps as outputs. InVEST returns results"
" in either biophysical terms, whether absolute quantities or relative "
"magnitudes (e.g., tons of sediment retained or % of change in sediment "
"retention) or economic terms (e.g., value of carbon sequestration.)"
