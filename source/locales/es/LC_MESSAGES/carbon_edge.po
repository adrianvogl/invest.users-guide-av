"The InVEST carbon edge effect model extends the approach of the InVEST "
"carbon model to account for forest carbon stock degradation due to the "
"creation of forest edges. It applies known relationships between carbon "
"storage and distance from forest edge to calculate edge effects in carbon"
" storage, and combines these estimates with carbon inventory data to "
"construct the overall carbon map. The model for edge effects pertains to "
"above-ground carbon only, because edge effects have not been documented "
"for the other carbon pools (below-ground, soil and dead matter). For all "
"other carbon pools, and for non-tropical forest classes, or if the model "
"is run without edge effects, it follows the IPCC (2006) inventory "
"approach to assigning carbon storage values by land cover class."

"The effects of future land-use change on carbon storage or sequestration "
"can be modeled by applying carbon storage estimates found in the "
"literature for different habitat types to each habitat found in a "
"landscape (e.g., Nelson et al. 2010). However, this approach assumes that"
" all habitat is equivalent in its quality of carbon storage, regardless "
"of where it occurs, despite the fact that there is substantial evidence "
"that fragmentation can play a dramatic role in altering carbon storage "
"and sequestration rates in tropical forests (Broadbent et al. 2008, "
"Dantas et al 2011, Laurance et al. 1997, 2000, 2001, 2002). For example, "
"core forest has been shown to store more than three times the carbon of "
"edge forest in Brazilian Atlantic forests (Dantas et al. 2011). Chaplin-"
"Kramer et al. (2015) investigated this pattern for the entire pantropics "
"using remotely sensed data on biomass (Baccini et al 2012) and associated"
" land cover (Friedl et al. 2011) and found a continuous relationship of "
"carbon storage degrading gradually toward a forest edge, which varies "
"substantially from region to region. This model accounts for these "
"documented edge effects in tropical forests, assigning carbon storage "
"based on the distance of a pixel to the nearest forest edge. This can "
"improve the overall accuracy of carbon storage estimates by 20% relative "
"to forest inventory approaches, and better captures the impacts of forest"
" degradation from fragmentation, beyond merely the area of habitat lost."

"The InVEST carbon edge effect model is an update to the InVEST carbon "
"model, which incorporates the degradation of carbon storage that occurs "
"due to edge effects in tropical forests. The user designates which land "
"cover classes are forest, and then the model uses pre-generated "
"regression results to predict the carbon throughout a forest parcel based"
" on its distance to the nearest forest edge. These results are combined "
"with the carbon assigned to non-forest classes through traditional "
"inventory methods (IPCC 2006) used in the InVEST carbon model, to "
"generate a map of above-ground carbon storage for all land cover classes."
" The InVEST carbon edge effect model can be run to calculate only above "
"ground carbon or all carbon pools, and it can be run with or without edge"
" effects. It is important to note that the edge effects regression only "
"pertains to above-ground carbon stocks because edge effects have only "
"been detected for above-ground biomass. To include the other three carbon"
" pools (below-ground, soil, and standing dead matter), carbon density "
"(Mg/ha) should be included for each land cover class in the biophysical "
"table."

"This model follows the methodology described in Chaplin-Kramer et al. "
"(2015), which constructs a series of regression models between forest "
"biomass density (Mg/ha) and distance from forest edge (km) for 100 km x "
"100 km grid cells throughout the pantropics. In grid cells where the "
"majority of pixels were from forest biomes, three candidate regression "
"models are considered to represent the relationship between biomass "
"density and distance to forest edge:"

" more simplistic) alternatives in cells where higher distances were "

"The results of these regressions can be found in the carbon edge "
"regression parameter shapefile "
"(*core_data/forest_carbon_edge_regression_model_parameters.shp*) in the "
"sample dataset that is provided for the InVEST carbon edge effect model. "
"For any forest pixel within the study region, the model calculates the "
"distance of that pixel from forest edge then calculates biomass to a "
"predefined number of nearest regression models which is then aggregated "
"to a single result using a distance linear interpolation scheme. The "
"model then converts biomass to carbon with a user provided conversion "
"factor, defaulted to 0.47 (IPCC 2006). The user can designate the number "
"of local models used in the interpolation scheme which is defaulted to 10"
" but can range anywhere from 1 (only closest point) to 2635 (every "
"regression model on the planet). Note that a selection of 1 may result in"
" artificially large differences in carbon when moving from one pixel to "
"the next where they fall in different regression grid cells. The higher "
"the number of regression grid cells selected, the smoother the transition"
" from one pixel to the next. The user may wish to select the number of "
"grid cells overlapping the entire study region in order to eliminate any "
