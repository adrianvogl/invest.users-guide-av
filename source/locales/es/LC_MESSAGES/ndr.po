"The objective of the InVEST nutrient delivery model is to map nutrient "
"sources from watersheds and their transport to the stream. This spatial "
"information can be used to assess the service of nutrient retention by "
"natural vegetation. The retention service is of particular interest for "
"surface water quality issues and can be valued in economic or social "
"terms, such as avoided treatment costs or improved water security through"
" access to clean drinking water."

"Land use change, and in particular the conversion to agricultural lands, "
"dramatically modifies the natural nutrient cycle. Anthropogenic nutrient "
"sources include point sources, e.g. industrial effluent or water "
"treatment plant discharges, and non-point sources, e.g. fertilizer used "
"in agriculture and residential areas. When it rains or snows, water flows"
" over the landscape carrying pollutants from these surfaces into streams,"
" rivers, lakes, and the ocean. This has consequences for people, directly"
" affecting their health or well-being (Keeler et al., 2012), and for "
"aquatic ecosystems that have a limited capacity to adapt to these "
"nutrient loads."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ndr.rst:17
msgid ""
"One way to reduce non-point source pollution is to reduce the amount of "
"anthropogenic inputs (i.e. fertilizer management). When this option "
"fails, ecosystems can provide a purification service by retaining or "
"degrading pollutants before they enter the stream. For instance, "
"vegetation can remove pollutants by storing them in tissue or releasing "
"them back to the environment in another form. Soils can also store and "
"trap some soluble pollutants. Wetlands can slow flow long enough for "
"pollutants to be taken up by vegetation. Riparian vegetation is "
"particularly important in this regard, often serving as a last barrier "
"before pollutants enter a stream."

"Land-use planners from government agencies to environmental groups need "
"information regarding the contribution of ecosystems to mitigating water "

"export and areas with highest filtration. The nutrient delivery and "
"retention model provides this information for non-point source "
"pollutants. The model was designed for nutrients (nitrogen and "
"phosphorous), but its structure can be used for other contaminants "
"(persistent organics, pathogens etc.) if data are available on the "
"loading rates and filtration rates of the pollutant of interest."

msgid "Overview"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ndr.rst:28
msgid ""
"The model uses a simple mass balance approach, describing the movement of"
" a mass of nutrient through space. Unlike more sophisticated nutrient "
"models, the model does not represent the details of the nutrient cycle "
"but rather represents the long-term, steady-state flow of nutrients "
"through empirical relationships. Sources of nutrient across the "
"landscape, also called nutrient loads, are determined based on a land "
"use/land cover (LULC) map and associated loading rates. Nutrient loads "
"can then be divided into sediment-bound and dissolved parts, which will "
"be transported through surface and subsurface flow, respectively, "
"stopping when they reach a stream. Note that modeling subsurface flow is "
"optional; the user can choose to model surface flow only. In a second "
"step, delivery factors are computed for each pixel based on the "
"properties of pixels belonging to the same flow path (in particular their"
" slope and retention efficiency of the land use). At the "
"watershed/subwatershed outlet, the nutrient export is computed as the sum"
" of the pixel-level contributions."

"Conceptual representation of the NDR model. Each pixel i is characterized"
" by its nutrient load, load\\ :sub:`i`, and its nutrient delivery ratio "
"(NDR), which is a function of the upslope area, and downslope flow path "
"(in particular the retention efficiencies of LULC types on the downslope "
"flow path). Pixel-level export is computed based on these two factors, "
"and the sediment export at the watershed level is the sum of pixel-level "
"nutrient exports."

msgid "Nutrient Loads"

"Loads are the sources of nutrients associated with each pixel of the "
"landscape. Consistent with the export coefficient literature (California "
"Regional Water Quality Control Board Central Coast Region, 2013; Reckhow "
"et al., 1980), load values for each LULC class are derived from empirical"
" measures of nutrient export (e.g. nutrient export running off urban "
"areas, crops, etc.). If information is available on the amount of "
"nutrient applied (e.g. fertilizer, livestock waste, atmospheric "
"deposition), it is possible to use it by estimating the on-pixel nutrient"
" use, and apply this correction factor to obtain the load parameters."

#: ../../source/ndr.rst:41
msgid ""
"Next, each pixel’s load is modified to account for the local runoff "
"potential. The LULC-based loads defined above are averages for the "
"region, but each pixel’s contribution will depend on the amount of runoff"
" transporting nutrients (Endreny and Wood, 2003; Heathwaite et al., "
"2005). As a simple approximation, the loads can be modified as follows:"

msgstr ""

"For each pixel, modified loads can be divided into sediment-bound and "
"dissolved nutrient portions. Conceptually, the former represents "
"nutrients that are transported by surface or shallow subsurface runoff, "
"while the latter represent nutrients transported by groundwater. Because "
"phosphorus particles are usually sediment bound and less likely to be "
"transported via subsurface flow, the model uses the subsurface option "
"only for nitrogen (designated by \\_n) The ratio between these two types "

"sensitivity to the resolution of the LULC raster. The literature on "
"riparian buffer removal efficiency suggests that retention lengths range "
"from 10 to 300 m (Mayer et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2009). In the absence"
" of local data for land uses that are not forest or grass, you can simply"
" set the retention length constant, equal to the pixel size: this will "
"result in the maximum retention efficiency being reached within a "
"distance of one pixel only. Another option is to treat the retention "
"length as a calibration parameter. In the absence of any other "
"information, start with a value at the mid-point of the range given above"
" (that is, 150m), then vary that value up and down during calibration to "
"find a good fit."
