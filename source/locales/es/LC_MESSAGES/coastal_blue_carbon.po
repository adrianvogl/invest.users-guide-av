"Marine and terrestrial ecosystems help regulate Earth's climate by adding"
" and removing greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide (CO\\ "
":sub:`2`) to and from the atmosphere.  Coastal marshes, mangroves, and "
"seagrasses, in particular, store large amounts of carbon in their "
"sediments, leaves, and other forms of biomass.  In addition to storing "
"carbon, marine ecosystems continually accumulate carbon in their "
"sediments, creating large reservoirs of long-term sequestered carbon. By "
"storing and sequestering carbon, marine ecosystems keep CO\\ :sub:`2` out"
" of the atmosphere where it would otherwise contribute to climate change."

"Mapping and modeling changes in carbon storage and sequestration for "
"coastal and marine habitats can present challenges.  The types of spatial"
" inputs and available information about the carbon cycle vary by "
"location.  Some study areas have high-quality data available for a "
"detailed analysis while other locations do not have the information "
"necessary to model changes in the position and function of coastal "
"vegetation.  Salt marsh, for example, is often studied in the context of "
"migration due to sea-level rise.  The combination of natural (e.g. sea-"
"level rise) and anthropogenic (e.g. salt marsh migration blocked by "
"roads) factors should be included in scenario maps and subsequent carbon "
"modeling where possible.  When exploring future land cover scenarios, "
"land cover map outputs produced by the SLAMM model (Sea Level Affecting "
"Marshes Model, developed by Warren Pinnacle) can be useful inputs to the "
"InVEST Coastal Blue Carbon model (Clougheet et al. 2010).  However, "
"because not all sites have the detailed elevation and habitat information"
" required to run SLAMM, this InVEST model provides a flexible approach "

msgid ""
"InVEST Coastal Blue Carbon models the carbon cycle through a bookkeeping-"
"type approach (Houghton, 2003). This approach simplifies the carbon cycle"
" by accounting for storage in three main pools (biomass, sediment carbon "
"(i.e. soil), and standing dead carbon (i.e. litter) see Figure 1).  "
"Accumulation of carbon in coastal habitats occurs primarily in sediments "
"(Pendleton et al., 2012).  The model requires users to provide maps of "
"coastal ecosystems that store carbon, such as mangroves and seagrasses.  "
"Users must also provide data on the amount of carbon stored in the three "
"carbon pools and the rate of annual carbon accumulation in the biomass "
"and sediments. If local information is not available, users can draw upon"
" the global database of values for carbon stocks and accumulation rates "
"sourced from the peer-reviewed literature that is included in the model."
"  If data from field studies or other local sources are available, these "
"values should be used instead of those in the global database. The model "
"requires land cover maps, which represent changes in human use patterns "
"in coastal areas or changes to sea level, to estimate the amount of "
"carbon lost or gained over a specified period of time.  The model "
"quantifies carbon storage across the land or seascape by summing the "
"carbon stored in these three carbon pools."

"An alternative to SCC is the market value of carbon credits approach. If "

" geographies and new markets are taking hold in Australia, California, "
"and Quebec (World Bank, 2012). These markets set a cap on total emissions"
" of carbon and require that emitters purchase carbon credits to offset "
"any emissions. Conservation efforts that increase sequestration can be "
"leveraged as a means to offset carbon emissions and therefore sequestered"
" carbon can potentially be monetized at the price established in a carbon"
" credit market. The means for monetizing carbon offsets depends "
"critically on the specific rules of each market, and therefore it is "
"important to determine whether or not your research context allows for "
"the sale of sequestration credits into a carbon market. It is also "
"important to note that the idiosyncrasies of market design drive carbon "
