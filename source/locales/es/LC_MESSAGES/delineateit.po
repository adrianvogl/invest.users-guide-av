"Many of the freshwater models in InVEST require watershed polygons to "
"aggregate the ecosystem service provides to beneficiaries. However, we've"
" found the creation of watersheds with existing tools to be difficult and"
" often requiring specific expertise and/or proprietary toolsets. To "
"address this need, we have developed our own watershed delineation "
"algorithm released in the PyGeoprocessing GIS package, and wrapped into a"
" UI inside of InVEST. All DEM routing is handled by PyGeoprocessing which"
" resolves hydrological sinks and plateaus and uses D8 to route flow "
"directions."

"**Detect Pour Points**: If this box is checked, the model will detect "
"pour points (watershed outlets) based on the DEM, and use these in place "
"of the user-provided outlet features vector. There is a pour point "
"located at the center of each pixel that flows off the edge of the raster"
" or into a nodata pixel. Flow direction is calculated from the DEM using "
"the D8 algorithm."

"**Outlet Features**: A vector that is used to specify areas from which "
"the watersheds should be delineated. These geometries may represent "
"stream intake points, population centers, roads, municipality boundaries "
"or other features of interest and may have geometries of any type "
"including, but not limited to, points, lines and polygons. Any fields "
"associated with this vector will be copied to the watershed vector as it "
"is constructed. Required if 'Detect Pour Points' is not checked."

"**Skip invalid geometries**: If this box is checked, the model will log a"
" ``WARNING`` and will skip delineation for any invalid features found in "
"the Outlet Features. If this box is unchecked and an invalid geometry if "
"found in the outlet vector, the model will crash with an informative "
"error. DelineateIt can only delineate watersheds from valid geometries, "
"so it is up to the user to ensure that all geometries are valid. These "
"may be resolved using the ArcGIS tool \"Check Geometry\" or QGIS tool "
"\"Fix geometries\"."

"**Snap points to the nearest stream**: If selected, any point features "
"within the outlet features will be snapped (relocated) to the nearest "
"stream, where streams are defined by a **Threshold Flow Accumulation** "
"value and the maximum distance to snap defined by **Pixel Distance to "
"Snap Outlet Points**. This input will have no effect if **Detect Pour "
"Points** is selected. **NOTE:** DelineateIt will only snap features if "
"they are ``POINT`` or ``MULTIPOINT`` geometries with a single component "
"point. All other geometry types will be unaltered."

"**Threshold Flow Accumulation**: If an outlet feature does not lie "
"directly on a stream, a very small watershed will be generated which is "
"usually not correct. So DelineateIt can snap outlet features with point "
"geometry to the nearest stream to make more robust watersheds. To do "
"this, the tool constructs a stream layer, which includes any pixels whose"
" flow accumulation values exceed this parameter. Smaller values of this "
"threshold produce streams with more tributaries, larger values produce "
"streams with fewer tributaries."

"**Pixel Distance to Snap Outlet Points**: If an outlet point does not lie"
" directly on a stream, a very small watershed will be generated which is "
"usually not correct. During watershed construction, DelineateIt will "
"search within a radius of the defined number of pixels around each outlet"
" point to find the nearest stream pixel. Streams are defined by the "
"threshold flow accumulation value listed above. Pixel distance is given "
"as the number of pixels, which is unitless. It is *not* an actual "
"distance (such as meters.) So if you give it a value of 3, DelineateIt "
"will search within a radius of 3 pixels around each outlet point looking "
"for a stream. Note that if the cell size is small, the actual distance "
"searched will be small, if the cell size is large, the actual distance "
"searched will be large. Also note that this snap distance will only be "
"applied to point geometries. Any other geometric types provided in the "
"outlet features vector will be used as they are."
