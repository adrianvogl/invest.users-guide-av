"The proximity-based scenario generator creates a set of contrasting land "
"use change maps that convert habitat in different spatial patterns. The "
"user determines which habitat can be converted and what they are "
"converted to, as well as type of pattern, based on proximity to the edge "
"of a focal habitat. In this manner, an array of land-use change patterns "
"can be generated, including pasture encroaching into forest from the "
"forest edge, agriculture expanding from currently cropped areas, forest "
"fragmentation, and many others. The resulting land-use maps can then be "
"used as inputs to InVEST models, or other models for biodiversity or "
"ecosystem services that are responsive to land use change."

msgid ""
"In order to understand the change in biodiversity and ecosystem services "
"(BES) resulting from change in land-use, it is often helpful to start "
"with a scenario or a set of scenarios that exhibit different types of "
"land-use change. Because many of the relationships between landscapes and"
" BES are spatially-explicit, a different pattern of habitat conversion "
"for the same total area of habitat converted can lead to very different "
"impacts on BES. This proximity-based scenario generator creates different"
" patterns of conversion according to user inputs designating focal "
"habitat and converted habitat, in contrast to but potentially "
"complementing the InVEST rule-based scenario generator that creates maps "
"of land-use change according to user-assigned probabilities that certain "
"transitions will occur. Thus, the intent of the InVEST proximity-based "
"scenario generator is not to forecast actual predicted patterns of "
"expansion, but rather to develop different patterns of land use change in"
" order to examine the relationship between land-use change and BES, and "
"how the relationship may differ depending on land use change assumptions."

"The tool can generate two scenarios at once (nearest to the edge and "
"farthest from the edge of a focal habitat), for a conversion to "
"particular habitat type for a given area. To convert to different habitat"
" types, different habitat amounts, or to designate different focal "
"habitats or converted habitats, the tool can be run multiple times in "
"sequence."

msgid ""
"Three types of landcover must be defined: 1) *Focal* *landcover* is the "
"landcover(s) that set the proximity rules from which the scenarios will "
"be determined. The scenario generator will convert habitat from the edge "
"or toward the edge of patches of these types of landcover. This does not "
"mean it will convert these land-covers, only that it will measure "
"distance to or from the edges in designating where the conversion will "
"happen. 2) *Convertible landcover* is the landcover(s) that can be "
"converted. These could be the same as the focal landcover(s), a subset, "
"or completely different. 3) *Replacement landcover* is the landcover type"
" to which the convertible landcovers will be converted. This can only be "
"one landcover type per model run."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/scenario_gen_proximity.rst:64
msgid ""
"Two scenarios can then be run at a time: 1) *Nearest to edge* means that "
"convertible landcover types closest to the edges of focal landcovers will"
" be converted to the replacement landcover. 2) *Farthest from edge* means"
" that convertible landcover types furthest from the edges of focal "
"landcover types will be converted to the replacement landcover. If this "
"scenario is chosen, the user can designate in how many steps the "
"conversion should occur. This is relevant if the focal landcover is the "
"same as the convertible land cover because the conversion of the focal "
"landcover will create new edges and hence will affect the distance "
"calculated from the edge of that landcover. If desired, the conversion "
"can occur in several steps, each time converting the farthest from the "
"edge of the focal landcover, causing a fragmentary pattern."

"Below are some examples of the types of scenarios that can be generated "

"scheme: 1 – Evergreen needleleaf forest; 2 – Evergreen broadleaf forest; "
"3 – Deciduous needleleaf forest; 4 – Deciduous broadleaf forest; 5 – "
