"The natural and scenic views of marine and coastal seascapes can "
"contribute to the well-being of local communities in a number of ways.  "
"Scenic amenities play an important role in augmenting local economies by "
"attracting visitors who support local businesses. The value of local "
"property partially depends on attributes of its location and scenic views"
" often increase local property values (Sanders and Polasky 2009, Bourassa"
" et al. 2004, Benson et al. 2004).   Local communities and their "
"residents often become strongly attached to views and show fervent "
"opposition to new development that has the potential to threaten the "
"integrity of existing views and diminish the benefits drawn from those "
"views (Ladenburg and Dubgaard 2009, Haggett 2011).  The InVEST scenic "
"quality model allows users to determine the locations from which new "
"nearshore or offshore features can be seen. It generates viewshed maps "
"that can be used to identify the visual footprint of new offshore "
"development and calculates the value of the impacted visibility.  Inputs "
"to the viewshed model include: topography and bathymetry, locations of "
"offshore facilities of interest, and the locations of viewers (e.g. "
"population centers or areas of interest such as parks or trails).  The "
"model does not quantify economic impacts of altering the viewshed, but it"
" can be adapted to compute viewshed metrics for use in a more detailed "
"valuation study.  A key limitation of the model is that it does not "
"currently account for the ways in which vegetation or land-based "
"infrastructure may constrain land areas that are visually affected by "
"offshore development."

msgid ""
"Coastal ecosystems are increasingly dominated by human activities.  This "
"rise in human activities can compromise the unique scenic qualities "
"associated with coastal and marine areas.  The coastline and 'seascape' "
"is an important economic asset that attracts visitors for tourism and "
"recreation and contributes to the general quality of life for people "
"living near the coast.  Near and offshore development projects often "
"raise considerable concern within the local communities that value the "
"natural seascape for its inherent beauty.  Visual impacts are external "
"effects that unless measured and accounted for, do not factor into the "
"calculus of weighing the costs and benefits of new coastal development.  "
"Applications using viewshed analysis range from the siting of aquaculture"
" facilities to minimize spatial competition with tourism activities "
"(Perez 2003) to seascape and shoreline visibility assessment of offshore "
"wind projects (Environmental Design and Research 2006).  Because scenic "
"beauty is an attribute generally considered to be important to people "
"living near the coast and for those who visit coastal areas to enjoy the "
"ocean and the marine environment, coastal planners can incorporate "
"measures of visual amenities and/or disamenities into broader policy "
"deliberations and planning exercises.  Because most applications of "
"viewshed analysis involve examining the negative impacts of new "
"facilities, language within the InVEST scenic quality model assumes the "
"objects viewed have a negative impact on views.  However, positive "
"interpretation of viewing these objects can be included with "
"interpretation of model results."

msgid ""
"The InVEST scenic quality model provides users with a simple way to "
"provide information about potential tradeoffs between nearshore and "
"offshore development proposals and the visual impacts of those projects."
"  The viewshed maps produced by the model can be used to identify coastal"
" areas that are most likely to be directly affected by additions to the "
"seascape.  They can serve as valuable input into broader analyses that "
"consider a range of services provided by the marine environment."

"This model can be used to compute the costs associated with offshore "
"visual impacts, these costs are likely to decrease as the location of "
"facilities moves further offshore, while the costs of installing and "
"operating offshore facilities generally increase with distance from the "
"shoreline. The few valuation studies that explore the economic magnitude "
"of visual disamenities resulting from offshore development projects show "
"a complex picture. One recent study found that individuals living along "
"the coast have external costs ranging from $27 to $80 resulting from the "
"visual disamenity of an offshore wind project (Krueger et al. 2010). In "
"contrast, Firestone et al. (2009) found that public acceptance for "
"offshore renewable energy projects is growing and may be less contentious"
" than previously anticipated."

"The scenic quality model provides information about the visibility of "
"offshore objects from the surrounding landscape or seascape.  Offshore "
"and nearshore development projects, such as renewable wave energy "
"facilities or aquaculture facilities, have the potential to impact the "
"visual amenities that are an important feature of many coastal areas.  "

"would like to identify areas where visual impacts may be an important "
"factor to incorporate into planning."

"The model inputs are divided into two groups: **General** has all the "
