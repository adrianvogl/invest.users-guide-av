"The Crop Production Percentile and Crop Production Regression models "
"estimate crop yield and nutrient value for a fixed set of crops, derived "

"Expanding agricultural production and closing yield gaps is a key "
"strategy for many governments and development agencies focused on poverty"
" alleviation and achieving food security. However, conversion of natural "
"habitats to agricultural production impacts other ecosystem services that"
" are key to sustaining the economic benefits that agriculture provides to"
" local communities. Intensive agricultural practices can add to pollution"
" loads in water sources, often necessitating future costly water "
"purification methods. Overuse of water also threatens the supply "
"available for hydropower or other services. Still, crop production is "
"essential to human well-being and livelihoods. The InVEST crop production"
" model allows detailed examination of the costs and benefits of this "
"vital human enterprise, including exploration of questions such as:"

"**Crop Production Rasters**: For each crop modeled, there will be a "
"raster (.tif) corresponding to that crop name and the type of modeling - "
"\"observed\", \"regression\", or \"yield\" plus percentile number "
"(25th/50th/75th/95th), and the user-supplied Suffix.  These rasters "

"There is also an **intermediate_output** folder, containing many files "
"that represent intermediate steps in the calculations of the final "

"be of interest if you are debugging a model run or want to understand the"
" intermediate steps better. It also contains a subdirectory that stores "
"metadata used internally to enable avoided re-computation."

"The **observed yield** outputs approximate actual crop yield in the area "
"of interest, circa the year 2000. The **percentile yield** and "
"**regression yield** outputs are useful if the crop is not currently "
"grown in the area of interest, or to approximate potential for increases "
"by closing yield gaps."
