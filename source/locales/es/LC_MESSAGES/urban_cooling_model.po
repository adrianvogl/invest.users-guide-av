"Urban heat mitigation (HM) is a priority for many cities that have "
"undergone heat waves in recent years. Vegetation can help reduce the "
"urban heat island (UHI) effect by providing shade, modifying thermal "
"properties of the urban fabric, and increasing cooling through "
"evapotranspiration. This has consequences for the health and wellbeing of"
" citizens through reduced mortality and morbidity, increased comfort and "
"productivity, and the reduced need for air conditioning (A/C). The InVEST"
" urban cooling model calculates an index of heat mitigation based on "
"shade, evapotranspiration, and albedo, as well as distance from cooling "
"islands (e.g. parks). The index is used to estimate a temperature "
"reduction by vegetation. Finally, the model estimates the value of the "
"heat mitigation service using two (optional) valuation methods: energy "
"consumption and work productivity."

"UHIs affect many cities around the world, with major consequences for "
"human health and wellbeing: high mortality or morbidity during heat "
"waves, high A/C consumption, and reduced comfort or work productivity. "
"The UHI effect, i.e. the difference between rural and urban temperatures,"
" is a result of the unique characteristics of cities due to two main "
"factors: the thermal properties of materials used in urban areas (e.g. "
"concrete, asphalt), which store more heat, and the reduction of the "
"cooling effect (through shade and evapotranspiration) of vegetation."

"Natural infrastructure therefore plays a role in reducing UHIs in cities."
" Using the rapidly-growing literature on urban heat modeling (Deilami et "
"al. 2018), the InVEST urban cooling model estimates the cooling effect of"
" vegetation based on commonly available data on climate, land use/land "
"cover (LULC), and (optionally) A/C use."

"The model first computes the cooling capacity (CC) index for each pixel "
"based on local shade, evapotranspiration, and albedo. This approach is "
"based on the indices proposed by Zardo et al. 2017 and Kunapo et al. "
"2018, to which we add albedo, an important factor for heat reduction. The"
" shade factor ('shade') represents the proportion of tree canopy (â‰¥2 m in"
" height) associated with each land use/land cover (LULC) category. Its "
"value is comprised between 0 and 1. The evapotranspiration index (ETI) "
"represents a normalized value of potential evapotranspiration, i.e. the "
"evapotranspiration from vegetation (or evaporation from soil, for "
"unvegetated areas). It is calculated for each pixel by multiplying the "
"reference evapotranspiration (:math:`ET0`, provided by the user) and the "
"crop coefficient (:math:`Kc` , associated with the pixel's LULC type), "
"and dividing by the maximum value of the :math:`ET0` raster in the area "
