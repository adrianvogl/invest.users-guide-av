"The InVEST Habitat and Species Risk Assessment (HRA/SRA) model allows "
"users to assess the cumulative risk posed to habitats and species by "
"human activities and to explore consequences for the delivery of "
"ecosystem services and biodiversity.  The condition of a habitat is a key"
" determinant of the ecosystem services it can provide; for example, "
"degraded coastal mangroves are less able to attenuate waves and reduce "
"coastal exposure.  Risk to species may indicate reduced sustainability "
"through time.  As anthropogenic stressors continue to diversify and "
"intensify, so too does the need for quick, clear and repeatable ways of "
"assessing risks to habitats and species, now and under future management "
"scenarios.  HRA/SRA utilizes a well-supported exposure-consequence "
"framework to assess spatial variation in cumulative risk from multiple "
"human activities across a land- or seascapes."

"identify areas at the greatest relative risk of degradation as well as "
"the primary causes of risk within a study region and among alternative "
"future scenarios. Model outputs can help identify areas where human "

"Habitats and species provide essential benefits for people, including "
"regulating, material, and non-material services (Pascual et al. 2017, "
"Díaz et al. 2018). For example, nearshore habitats such as kelp forests "
"and eelgrass meadows protect  shorelines from storms, provide nursery "
"habitat for fisheries, and store and sequester carbon. Terrestrial "
"habitats like riparian forests absorb excess nutrients and sediment, "
"provide habitat for riverine fish species, and mitigate inland flooding "
"after rain events. As these habitats (or species) become degraded by "
"human activities, the ecosystem services they provide are threatened. "
"Recent global analyses have revealed that almost no area of the world's "
"oceans is untouched by human impacts (Halpern et al. 2008). Thus, an "
"understanding of the location and intensity of human impacts on nearshore"
" ecosystems is an essential component of informed and successful "
"terrestrial, coastal, and ocean management. The InVEST HRA model allows "
"users to assess the threat of human activities to the health of these "
"ecosystems and species.  The model has been successfully applied in "
"numerous locations across the world (e.g. Arkema et al. 2014, Cabral et "
"al. 2015, Chung et al. 2015, Duggan et al. 2015, Ma et al. 2016, Elliff "

"To assess the exposure of ecosystems and habitats or species to human "

"Guidelines for scoring the default criterion are summarized below (:ref"

"Note that \"spatial overlap\" is a special exposure criteria that is "
"always included, and does not need to be defined or scored by the user "

"criteria and the equations below.  If a stressor and a habitat or species"
" do not overlap in a particular grid cell, Exposure, Consequence, and "
"Risk are 0 in that cell. The scores for all the other criteria are inputs"

"In addition to providing management tools and insight, HRA/SRA is an "
"integral step in connecting the multitude of stressors to changes in "
"ecosystem services.  InVEST ecosystem service models include the location"
" and/or quality of habitat as a factor in determining the delivery of "
"services and this input to service models can be modified based on risk "
"results.  For example, coastal vulnerability depends on the presence of "
"coastal habitats and the ability of those habitats to attenuate waves.  "
"If these coastal habitats are at high risk, they may be less capable of "
"attenuating waves. Demonstrating the possibility of linking HRA and "
"ecosystem service models, the Belize Coastal Zone Management Authority "
"and Institute (CZMAI) and Natural Capital Project scientists used HRA and"
" three InVEST ecosystem service models to design an Integrated Coastal "
"Zone Management Plan for the country.  To estimate spatial variation and "
"change in ecosystem services, they first quantified change in the "
"distribution, abundance, and other characteristics of three habitats: "
"coral reefs, mangrove forests, and seagrass beds. They began with an HRA "
"analysis to determine which habitats and where were most at risk for "
"degradation from the cumulative impacts of human activities currently and"
" three future scenarios (Arkema et al. 2014).  This analysis produced "
"maps of high, medium, and low risk of habitat degradation in the coastal "
"zone and marine waters.  Arkema et al. 2015 used these maps to estimate "
"the area of functional habitat capable of providing ecosystem services in"
" each scenario. In high and medium areas, they assumed that 0% and 50%, "
"respectively, of the existing habitat was capable of providing services; "
"in low-risk areas, they considered all habitat to be functional (Arkema "
"et al. 2015)."

" eelgrass, saltmarsh, and oyster beds as determined in an HRA analysis to"
" losses in recreational fishing, recreational oyster harvesting, and "
"commercial aquaculture using a benefits-transfer approach with "
"implications for restoration planning and aquaculture siting.  When used "
"in conjunction with models that estimate habitat-induced changes in "
"ecosystem services, HRA can help to evaluate trade-offs among human "
"activities and benefits that ecosystems provide to people."

"The InVEST HRA/SRA model is similar to the InVEST Habitat Quality model "
"in that both models allow users to identify regions on a landscape or "

"current and future human activities to prioritize management strategies "
"that best mitigate risk."

"A primary goal of conservation is the protection of biodiversity; "
"biodiversity is intricately linked to the production of ecosystem "
"services. While some people and institutions consider biodiversity itself"
" to be an ecosystem service, the InVEST Habitat Quality model treats it "
"as an independent attribute of natural systems, with its own intrinsic "
"value (InVEST does not monetize biodiversity). InVEST includes a habitat "
"quality model because natural resource managers, corporations and "
"conservation organizations are becoming increasingly interested in "
"understanding how and where biodiversity and ecosystem services align in "
"space and how management actions affect both.  The biodiversity model "
"uses habitat quality and rarity as a proxy for diversity."

"When developing a similar model with marine systems in mind (as was the "
"case for HRA/SRA), differences in data availability (e.g., the lack of an"
" analog to land-use/land-cover maps in marine systems) and differences in"
" thinking (e.g., the prevalence of a risk-assessment framework in "
"fisheries science) led us to the development of the habitat (and species)"
" risk assessment model described in this chapter. Both the Habitat "
"Quality and the Habitat Risk Assessment models can be used across systems"
" to identify areas on a landscape or seascape where the risk posed by "
"human activities is highest. However, the modeling approaches differ in "
"several ways. First, the exposure-consequence framework of the HRA/SRA "
"model allows model results to be interpreted in a manner that helps users"
" explore which types of management strategies are likely to most "
"effectively reduce risk (Figure 1). For example, ecosystems with high "
"exposure and high consequence may be targeted for intense active "
"management, while effective strategies for ecosystems with low exposure "
"to human stressors but high consequence may include close monitoring but "
"little active intervention unless exposure increases. Second, the "
"transparent flexible structure, in addition to the ability to rank data "
"quality and importance, facilitate HRA/SRA’s use in both data-rich and "
"data-poor situations. Finally, the Habitat Quality model is better suited"
" for terrestrial applications than marine applications because it "
"requires a land use land cover map as an input. The HRA/SRA model can be "
"used in both marine and terrestrial systems."
