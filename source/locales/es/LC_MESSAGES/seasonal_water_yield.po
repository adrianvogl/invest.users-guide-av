"There is a high demand for tools estimating the effect of landscape "
"management on the water supply service, for uses like irrigation, "
"domestic consumption and hydropower production. While the InVEST Annual "
"Water Yield model provides an estimate of total water yield for a "
"catchment, many applications require knowledge of seasonal flows, "
"especially during the dry season. This requires the understanding of "
"hydrological processes in a catchment, in particular the partitioning "
"between quickflow (occurring during or shortly after rain events) and "
"baseflow (occurring during dry weather). In highly seasonal climates, "
"baseflow is likely to provide greater value than quickflow, unless "
"significant storage (e.g., a large reservoir) is available. The InVEST "
"Seasonal Water Yield model seeks to provide guidance regarding the "
"contribution of land parcels to the generation of both baseflow and "
"quickflow. The model computes spatial indices that quantify the relative "
"contribution of a parcel of land to the generation of both baseflow and "
"quickflow. Currently, there are no quantitative estimates of baseflow, "
"only the relative contributions of pixels; a separate tool is in "
"development to address this question."

"Understanding the effect of landscape management on seasonal flow is of "
"critical importance for watershed management. The contribution of a given"
" parcel to streamflow depends on a number of environmental factors "
"including climate, soil, vegetation, slope, and position along the flow "
"path (determining if the pixel may receive water from upslope or if water"
" recharged may later be evapotranspired)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/seasonal_water_yield.rst:39
msgid ""
"Water flowing across the landscape is either evaporated, transpired, "
"withdrawn by a well, or leaves the watershed as deep groundwater flow or "
"streamflow. If we consider an individual pixel, and its value with "
"respect to water yield, we can consider two approaches:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/seasonal_water_yield.rst:44
msgid ""
"The first gives credit to the net amount of water generated on a pixel as"
" equal to the incoming precipitation minus the losses to "
"evapotranspiration on that pixel. In this scheme, it is possible for "
"actual evapotranspiration to be greater than precipitation if water is "
"supplied to the site from upslope. Thus, the net generation could be "
"negative. This approach pays no heed to the eventual disposition of that "
"water generated on that pixel; that is, it does not consider whether the "
"water actually shows up as streamflow or is evaporated or withdrawn "
"somewhere along its path."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/seasonal_water_yield.rst:54
msgid ""
"The second approach gives credit to the water from a parcel that actually"
" shows up as streamflow. Thus, if a parcel generates water that is later "
"evaporated, the contribution is considered to be nil."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/seasonal_water_yield.rst:58
msgid ""
"The former approach puts greater emphasis on the land-use and land-cover "
"of a site, since the focus is on net generation from that pixel. It "
"accounts for the subsidy of water from upslope pixels, but does not "
"consider downslope effects. It represents the *potential* to generate "
"streamflow (not an actual generation of flow)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/seasonal_water_yield.rst:64
msgid ""
"The second approach puts more emphasis on the topographic position of a "
"pixel, as that will determine the potential for water generated on that "
"pixel to be consumed before becoming streamflow. It represents the actual"
" streamflow generated by a pixel. Since actual streamflow cannot be less "
"than zero, this approach, unlike the first, will result in indices that "
"are greater than or equal to zero."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/seasonal_water_yield.rst:71
msgid ""
"We use both of these concepts to develop a set of three indices, one for "
"quickflow, one for recharge (which represents the ‘potential baseflow’), "
"and one for actual baseflow. Here, baseflow is defined as the generation "
"of streamflow with watershed residence times of months to years, while "
"quickflow represents the generation of streamflow with watershed "
"residence times of hours to days."
