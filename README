These source files, in restructured text format, are designed to be compiled into stand-alone HTML documents 
(and sometimes PDF) using the Sphinx documentation generator (http://sphinx.pocoo.org/).

See requirements.txt for the python dependencies required to build the documentation. 
Once you have installed these dependencies on your system, or in a python environment,
execute the following command in this directory which contains the Makefile.

make html

Then find the html documents in "build/html" and view them in a web browser to evaulate for correctness.




The section below on the InVEST Pimer is not currently part of our routine build process.

The InVEST Primer
=================

The InVEST primer is a subset of User's Guide chapters that have been extracted from their
source RST files and translated for distribution.  Typically, the primer includes the 
User's Guide chapter Summary, Introduction, and Interpreting Results sections.


Annotating RST sections for inclusion in the Primer
---------------------------------------------------

The primer is merely a subset of the user's guide, where certain sections are 
explicitly included by annotating the source RST files in /source.  To annotate a 
section for inclusion in the primer, the following sphinx comment markup is used:

.. primer

# Insert some sphinx docs here

.. primerend

The `.. primer` comment denotes the beginning of a section to be included in the primer,
and the `.. primerend` comment denotes the end of the section.  Any RST file in /source
with these tags will be included.  Most files without these comments will be excluded, 
though there are a couple exceptions which will always be included.

To extract these sections into new RST files, use:

    $ make primer

This will analyze the User's Guide source RST files and copy over the needed RST and
images into /primer/source.  These files may be committed if needed, though their content
will be duplicated from the main User's Guide source.

Translating the Primer
----------------------

Prerequisites:
  * sphinx-intl (install via pip)
  * gettext (install via system package manager)

The general workflow for translating the primer is:
  * Mark up the relevant sections in the RST source with `.. primer` and `.. primerend`
  * Build the primer source by calling `make primer`.
      This places the primer source files into /primer/source, 
      and places the gettext .pot files into /primer/build/locale
  * `cd primer`
  * Build the per-language .po files by calling `make trans-po`.
      This places .po files for each language into /primer/locale/<lang code>/LC_MESSAGES/.
      These are the files that should be sent to the translator(s).
  * Send the .po files to the translators!
  * When you receive the translated files back from the translators, save them to 
      their appropriate LC_MESSAGES folder and commit them to hg.
  * Build the translated documentation with `make trans-build`.
      This will build HTML documentation for each language defined in /primer/Makefile.

To add more translations to the documentation, add its language code to the LANGS variable
in primer/Makefile.  ISO 639-1 is preferable.
