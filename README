These source files, in restructured text format, are designed to be compiled into stand-alone HTML documents 
(and sometimes PDF) using the Sphinx documentation generator (http://sphinx.pocoo.org/).

See requirements.txt for the python dependencies required to build the documentation. 
Once you have installed these dependencies on your system, or in a python environment,
execute the following command in this directory which contains the Makefile.

make html

Then find the html documents in "build/html" and view them in a web browser to evaulate for correctness.
