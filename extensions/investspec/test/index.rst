This section outlines the specific data used by the model. See the
Appendix for the Carbon Storage model for additional information on data
sources and pre-processing of non-forest or non-tropical LULC classes.
Please consult the InVEST sample data (located in the folder where
InVEST is installed, if you also chose to install sample data) for
examples of all of these data inputs. This will help with file type,
folder structure and table formatting. Note that all GIS inputs must be
in the same projected coordinate system and in linear meter units.
